# Design
We hope to use portable devices in our pockets to connect with the private artificial intelligence deployed at home anytime and anywhere. At the same time, our private artificial intelligence will help us solve everything. No matter where you are, Gun-Relay will provide you with powerful decentralized communication power.

We assume the design scenario of a controller. We use mobile devices to send a message to AI, which is to let our drone take off, circle the sky, and then fly to my position, while replying to the control coordinate list. At this time, the data of the intercepted coordinate field will be forwarded to the drone controller, such as List: y.1 x.3 y.9 x.2..... When the drone receives the coordinate list, it will perform tasks according to the coordinate data in the list. Eventually, it will fly to our position, but make sure that the battery is sufficient. All of this does not require cloud servers and cloud service APIs. You can also communicate without using the public network. We can run repeater broadcast hotspots on old computers and Android phones.

All processes maintain military encryption security standards. You can deploy the repeater by yourself and turn on the storage, and observe the changes of data in the store to confirm the security standards.

I modified it on the basis of Gun's design concept. It does not fully depend on the consensus mechanism. Instead, through Gun incremental snapshot data to the local independent form, block and block data are classified and archived through self-increasing keys. This will improve the performance of data indexing, because Gun is a graph database, which is sorted by msgId, which will encounter some trouble when the data volume is large and the data relationship is too complex. At the same time, further improve the stability of data. Sometimes the truth may be distorted, but we only trust private snapshot data. This is a friendly module for model training data. At the same time, you can easily migrate training data and address book chat records and other data. This is the design of point-to-point data. 

Channel data depends on Gun's powerful content addressing and multicast mechanism. This gives TalkFlow strong network self-healing capabilities and data recovery capabilities.
