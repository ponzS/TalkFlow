  "iosNotificationDescription": "In iOS, APNs is required for the best notification experience, while we strive to make everything self-hostable by users. Therefore, we default to using Bark as the primary remote notification tool in iOS.",
  "linuxAndroidPwaDescription": "In Linux-Android-PWA versions, you can customize hardware drivers, meaning notifications you receive can be handled by other devices without being sent to any third-party servers.",
  "privacyConsiderationDescription": "For privacy considerations, we make remote notifications an independent choice, as messages with remote notifications will be sent to the remote notification server, which then sends them to your device and triggers hardware-driven APIs to make your device vibrate and render content. For non-iOS versions, remote notifications only go through your own server.",
